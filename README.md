## Run Feed Reader Test Locally

Please open index.html in a browser to run the Feed Reader for testing

## Instructions

The Feed Reader Testing site opens a Feed Reader that uses Jasmine Testing to test against the JavaScript code that has been written. The hidden menu on the left hand side of the screen can be opened by clicking the icon and then a different feed can be chosen for a different blog.

## What to Expect

One can expect to be able to see that all of the tests pass showing that the code for the app was written correctly. By changing some code in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js you can see that there will be errors on the tests

## Built With

* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) - The tester used against the code
